# 🎨 CSS Art: Night Mountainscape 🌙


Welcome to my CSS Art project!  
I created this serene night mountain landscape using only **pure CSS** — no images, no SVGs, just clean, creative lines of CSS code. ✨

## 🖌️ About the Artwork

This scene features:
- Majestic mountains with snowy peaks ⛰️
- A glowing full moon 🌕
- Calm waters with a perfect reflection 🌊
- Minimalist pine trees 🌲
- Twinkling stars and floating clouds 🌟☁️

All crafted using CSS properties like:
- **Flexbox**  
  For aligning and positioning elements in the layout.
  
- **Position Properties** (`relative`, `absolute`)  
  To place the elements (moon, mountains, trees, etc.) precisely in the scene.

- **Gradients**  
  For creating smooth color transitions in the sky, water, and reflections.

- **Borders**  
  To design shapes like the mountains and trees.

- **Transformations** (`rotate`, `scale`, `translate`)  
  For tilting and positioning objects dynamically.
  
- **CSS Animations** ✨  
  To add life to the scene, like subtle movements or glowing effects.
